"""Test Fortran 2008 rule R1118 (C1113).

parent-identifier is ancestor-module-name [ : parent-submodule-name ]

C1113 The ancestor-module-name shall be the name of a nonintrinsic
module; the parent-submodule name shall be the name of a
descendant of that module.

It is not possible to test C1113 with fparser as the names may be
in different files.
