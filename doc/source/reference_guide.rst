Reference Guide
===============

The fparser Reference Guide consists of auto-generated
API documentation produced using both the :ref:`AutoAPI Sphinx plugin <autoapi>`
and :ref:`Doxygen <doxygen>`.

.. _autoapi:

Sphinx and AutoAPI-generated Documentation
------------------------------------------

The Sphinx/AutoAPI documentation is
:doc:`here. <autoapi/index>` or you can use the navigation
pane on the left.

.. _doxygen:

Doxygen-generated Documentation
-------------------------------

.. raw:: html

   <p>
   If you would prefer to see the Doxgen-generated pages then they are 
   <a  href="_static/html/index.html">here.</a> Since these are generated
   separately there are no links back to this Sphinx-generated content - you
   will need to use the back button on your browser.
   <p>

.. note:: Many of the classes used in the implementation of fparser
	  are constructed dynamically at runtime. As a result, they will not
	  appear in the documentation generated by Doxygen.
